INTRODUCTION
Rationale
Fire incidents are a persistent threat to the safety and
well-being of individuals, businesses, and communities. In 2024,
the city of Baguio experienced a concerning rise in fire-related
incidents, endangering lives, causing significant property
damage, and disrupting local economies. These incidents highlight
the urgent need for effective fire prevention measures to protect
residents and businesses from the devastating impacts of fire.
Fire mitigation is particularly crucial in urban areas, as
previous studies have shown that fire disasters not only result
in great economic losses but also pose significant challenges to
community restoration and safety. According to Kurata et al.
(2022), understanding the factors affecting fire mitigation
behaviors among citizens is essential to designing effective
prevention strategies, particularly in densely populated regions
like urban centers.
Fire-related risks are often exacerbated by a lack of
awareness, inadequate fire safety education, and neglect of
essential preventive measures such as regular inspections, proper
equipment maintenance, and compliance with safety standards.
According to the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP), smoking and
open flames from cooking accounted for 190 and 155 fire cases,
respectively, during the first quarter of 2024. Electrical

ignition also posed a significant risk, with 144 cases caused by
arcing, 97 by loose connections, and 62 by overloading (BFP,
2024). These statistics underscore the pressing need for
heightened fire safety awareness, particularly in residential
settings, to address preventable causes effectively. Despite the
presence of fire safety regulations, gaps in implementation and
enforcement, combined with limited access to resources and
professional expertise, leave communities vulnerable. Addressing
these gaps requires a multi-faceted approach, including enhanced
education, stronger enforcement of safety standards, and improved
access to fire prevention tools and training.
This capstone project aligns with the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, Sustainable Cities and
Communities, by focusing on enhancing fire safety in Baguio City
through innovative and proactive solutions. Recognizing the vital
role of education and engagement in fostering a culture of
safety, the project aims to empower residents with the knowledge,
tools, and motivation to prevent and respond to fire incidents
effectively. Specifically, the project contributes to SDG target
11.5, which seeks to significantly reduce the number of deaths,
people affected, and economic losses caused by disasters by 2030,
with a focus on protecting vulnerable populations (Global Goals
Website). By addressing fire safety risks, this initiative aligns
Approval Sheet 2
with the goal of mitigating the adverse effects of disasters and
fostering resilience within communities.
The Baguio City Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) expressed
deep concern over the rising number of fire incidents in the
city, particularly those involving residential areas. Fire
Officer Ola Bai-wo emphasized that these fires not only endanger
lives but also strain their resources, making it increasingly
challenging to respond effectively to emergencies. The station
also highlighted recurring issues such as the public's limited
awareness of fire safety protocols and the widespread neglect of
preventive measures, including regular inspections and the use of
standard materials for electrical installations. These sentiments
underscore the need for community-based solutions that prioritize
education, collaboration, and proactive measures to mitigate fire
risks and foster a safer environment for all residents.
Project Objectives
 The main objective of this study is to develop a gamified
web-based application that enhances fire safety awareness and
prevention practices among residents of Baguio City.
Specifically, it aims to achieve the following:

1. Educate users on fire prevention measures, including proper
electrical wiring practices and handling of open flames.
2. Promote regular fire safety inspections through gamified
tasks and incentives.
3. Enhance community preparedness by simulating real-life fire
scenarios and response techniques.
4. Foster collaboration with local authorities and
professionals to ensure accurate and practical fire safety
guidelines.
Proposed Solutions
To address the persistent issue of fire incidents in Baguio
City, this study proposes the development of a gamified web-based
application as a comprehensive fire safety solution. The
application combines education, technology, and community
engagement to empower residents with practical knowledge and
tools for fire prevention and response.
The proposed application will feature interactive
educational modules for both children and adults, using gamified
elements such as challenges, rewards, and progressive levels to
sustain engagement.

By incorporating this IT emerging technology, the solution
aims to bridge existing gaps in fire safety education, improve
awareness, and foster a proactive approach to fire prevention
within the community.
