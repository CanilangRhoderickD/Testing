INTRODUCTION
Rationale
Fire incidents are a persistent threat to the safety and
well-being of individuals, businesses, and communities. In 2024,
the city of Baguio experienced a concerning rise in fire-related
incidents, endangering lives, causing significant property
damage, and disrupting local economies. These incidents highlight
the urgent need for effective fire prevention measures to protect
residents and businesses from the devastating impacts of fire.
Fire mitigation is particularly crucial in urban areas, as
previous studies have shown that fire disasters not only result
in great economic losses but also pose significant challenges to
community restoration and safety. According to Kurata et al.
(2022), understanding the factors affecting fire mitigation
behaviors among citizens is essential to designing effective
prevention strategies, particularly in densely populated regions
like urban centers.
Fire-related risks are often exacerbated by a lack of
awareness, inadequate fire safety education, and neglect of
essential preventive measures such as regular inspections, proper
equipment maintenance, and compliance with safety standards.
According to the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP), smoking and
open flames from cooking accounted for 190 and 155 fire cases,
respectively, during the first quarter of 2024. Electrical

ignition also posed a significant risk, with 144 cases caused by
arcing, 97 by loose connections, and 62 by overloading (BFP,
2024). These statistics underscore the pressing need for
heightened fire safety awareness, particularly in residential
settings, to address preventable causes effectively. Despite the
presence of fire safety regulations, gaps in implementation and
enforcement, combined with limited access to resources and
professional expertise, leave communities vulnerable. Addressing
these gaps requires a multi-faceted approach, including enhanced
education, stronger enforcement of safety standards, and improved
access to fire prevention tools and training.
This capstone project aligns with the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, Sustainable Cities and
Communities, by focusing on enhancing fire safety in Baguio City
through innovative and proactive solutions. Recognizing the vital
role of education and engagement in fostering a culture of
safety, the project aims to empower residents with the knowledge,
tools, and motivation to prevent and respond to fire incidents
effectively. Specifically, the project contributes to SDG target
11.5, which seeks to significantly reduce the number of deaths,
people affected, and economic losses caused by disasters by 2030,
with a focus on protecting vulnerable populations (Global Goals
Website). By addressing fire safety risks, this initiative aligns
Approval Sheet 2
with the goal of mitigating the adverse effects of disasters and
fostering resilience within communities.
The Baguio City Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) expressed
deep concern over the rising number of fire incidents in the
city, particularly those involving residential areas. Fire
Officer Ola Bai-wo emphasized that these fires not only endanger
lives but also strain their resources, making it increasingly
challenging to respond effectively to emergencies. The station
also highlighted recurring issues such as the public's limited
awareness of fire safety protocols and the widespread neglect of
preventive measures, including regular inspections and the use of
standard materials for electrical installations. These sentiments
underscore the need for community-based solutions that prioritize
education, collaboration, and proactive measures to mitigate fire
risks and foster a safer environment for all residents.

DESIGN THINKING
This chapter discusses the design thinking methodologies,
and the different phases the researchers have undertaken to
identify and validate the problem and solution based on user
feedback.
Introduction to Design Thinking
Design thinking is a user-centered methodology that guided
the researchers in understanding the core issues of the study,
identifying effective solutions, and ensuring that the proposed
system is user-friendly. By focusing on user feedback and
iterative testing, design thinking helped uncover key features
that would address both the primary and secondary challenges
identified throughout the research process. This approach not
only provided a structured framework for problem-solving but also
ensured that the final solution would be both practical and
tailored to the needs of the users, making the system more
accessible and relevant.
Figure 1
Design Thinking Methodologies
Approval Sheet 2
As illustrated in the table/figure before this section, the
design thinking methodology is broken down into five main stages:
Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test. These stages are
designed to help researchers approach complex problems in a usercentric manner, fostering creativity and innovation while
addressing the real needs of users. Each stage builds on the
previous one, allowing for a structured yet flexible process. The
"Empathize" phase involves gaining a deep understanding of users’
needs, while the "Define" phase focuses on clearly articulating
the problem. "Ideate" sparks brainstorming of potential
solutions, followed by "Prototype," where these ideas are brought
to life in tangible forms. Finally, "Test" involves evaluating
prototypes and gathering feedback for further refinement. The
following sections delve deeper into the researchers’ approach
and processes during each of these stages, providing further
insight into how these phases were applied in the study.

Empathize
Empathize. The researchers focused on deeply understanding
the experiences and challenges faced by residents regarding fire
safety. This involved engaging with the target users through
interviews, surveys, and observations to gather qualitative data
about their perceptions, behaviors, and knowledge gaps related to
fire prevention. By immersing themselves in the users'
environments, the researchers aimed to uncover the emotional and
practical barriers that hinder effective fire safety practices.
This empathetic approach ensured that the subsequent design
solutions would be grounded in real user needs, fostering a more
impactful educational experience.

5-Why Analysis

 The analysis begins by addressing immediate causes, such as
faulty wiring and overload circuits, and traces these issues back
through several layers. These include aging infrastructure, poor
Approval Sheet 2
workmanship, and a lack of resident awareness and training on
fire safety. Further investigation reveals systemic issues, such
as inadequate maintenance, the use of substandard materials, and
insufficient government funding for safety initiatives.
At the root of these problems, the paper highlights a
culture of under-prioritization of fire safety, where cost-saving
measures, over-reliance on DIY solutions, and a general lack of
awareness about risks and regulations persist. The research
emphasizes the importance of improving education, enforcement,
and access to professional services to mitigate fire risks and
safeguard lives.
The paper concludes by proposing targeted solutions to
address these root causes, including enhanced fire safety
education, stricter enforcement of regulations, and investment in
quality materials and professional installations. It calls for a
comprehensive approach to fire safety that integrates public
awareness, infrastructure improvements, and proactive safety
practices.

Empathy Map

In the empathizing stage of this research, we identified
several key challenges and insights regarding individuals'
approach to fire safety in the home. Many participants do not
regularly inspect electrical wiring due to a lack of knowledge or
awareness about the correct procedures for such inspections. Fire
safety drills, if conducted at all, are often sporadic and
typically limited to specific periods, such as fire prevention
month, rather than being implemented as part of a regular safety
routine. There is also a tendency to forget to unplug appliances
or charging devices, which increases the potential for electrical
fires. Financial constraints were a recurring theme, with many
individuals citing budget limitations as a barrier to purchasing
necessary fire safety equipment or hiring professional services
for home inspections. Furthermore, participants expressed
Approval Sheet 2
unawareness about the proper methods for inspecting electrical
wiring in the home, and a general reluctance to attend fire
safety seminars due to time constraints and other competing
priorities. When discussing fire safety programs, participants
often noted that these initiatives were not as effective as they
could be, highlighting the absence of hands-on training (e.g.,
using fire extinguishers). Emotional responses to these barriers
included a sense of anxiety about the possibility of fire
incidents, coupled with a feeling of helplessness due to limited
resources and knowledge. While there was a strong concern for
family safety, many felt overwhelmed by the complexity of fire
safety maintenance, particularly in the context of busy
schedules. Participants also expressed guilt for not taking more
proactive action, though this sentiment was tempered by the
understanding that time and budget constraints significantly
hindered their ability to engage in regular fire safety
practices.
Define
Define. On this stage of the design thinking, the
researchers should be able to identify the values that they could
offer to their target users. The researchers created a value
proposition canvas for them to identify the needs of their target
users and to Identify the features that they must create for the
system to be useful for the target users.

problems encountered by their target users. On the right side of
the figure 4, It expresses the struggles and insights of the
target users. While on the left are the proposed solutions to
satisfy the needs and resolve the problems encountered by the
target users.
Ideate
Ideate. The researchers brainstormed a wide range of
potential solutions to address the identified challenges related
to fire safety education. This phase encouraged creativity and
open-mindedness, allowing the team to explore various concepts
without immediate judgment or limitations.
Approval Sheet 2
The goal was to generate innovative ideas that could
effectively engage users and enhance their understanding of fire
prevention. The researchers considered incorporating gamification
elements, interactive simulations, and real-life scenarios to
make the learning experience more relatable and enjoyable. By
leveraging user feedback gathered during the "Empathize" phase,
the team aimed to ensure that the proposed solutions would
resonate with the target audience, ultimately fostering a deeper
commitment to fire safety practices.
Through collaborative brainstorming sessions, the
researchers identified key features that could be integrated into
the web-based application, such as quizzes, challenges, and
rewards systems, which would not only educate users but also
motivate them to actively participate in fire prevention efforts.
This ideation process was crucial in laying the foundation for
the subsequent prototyping and testing stages, ensuring that the
final product would be both effective and user-friendly
