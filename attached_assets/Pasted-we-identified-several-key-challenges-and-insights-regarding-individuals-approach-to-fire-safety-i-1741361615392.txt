we identified
several key challenges and insights regarding individuals'
approach to fire safety in the home. Many participants do not
regularly inspect electrical wiring due to a lack of knowledge or
awareness about the correct procedures for such inspections. Fire
safety drills, if conducted at all, are often sporadic and
typically limited to specific periods, such as fire prevention
month, rather than being implemented as part of a regular safety
routine. There is also a tendency to forget to unplug appliances
or charging devices, which increases the potential for electrical
fires. Financial constraints were a recurring theme, with many
individuals citing budget limitations as a barrier to purchasing
necessary fire safety equipment or hiring professional services
for home inspections. Furthermore, participants expressed

unawareness about the proper methods for inspecting electrical
wiring in the home, and a general reluctance to attend fire
safety seminars due to time constraints and other competing
priorities. When discussing fire safety programs, participants
often noted that these initiatives were not as effective as they
could be, highlighting the absence of hands-on training (e.g.,
using fire extinguishers). Emotional responses to these barriers
included a sense of anxiety about the possibility of fire
incidents, coupled with a feeling of helplessness due to limited
resources and knowledge. While there was a strong concern for
family safety, many felt overwhelmed by the complexity of fire
safety maintenance, particularly in the context of busy
schedules. Participants also expressed guilt for not taking more
proactive action, though this sentiment was tempered by the
understanding that time and budget constraints significantly
hindered their ability to engage in regular fire safety
practices.

researchers should be able to identify the values that they could
offer to their target users. The researchers created a value
proposition canvas for them to identify the needs of their target
users and to Identify the features that they must create for the
system to be useful for the target users.
